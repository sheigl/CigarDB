# CigarDB
I created this application to catalog and rate favorited cigars by uses

# MVC
I have attempted to create my own simple MVC with this application, to help my understanding of the Model, View, Controller pattern concepts.

# Authentication
This application authenticates users and stores encrypted passwords (with salt).

# User Profiles
This application uses user profiles. Each user area contains favorite cigars that they can then create notes and rate each cigar.
